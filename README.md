# 100-days-of-code

I'll try to add a folder for each day.

### Day 1
`datetime`-parsing and doing stuff with dates inside log-files.
I predict that this will be useful in the future.

Also a stopwatch

### Day 2
Pomodoro Timer

It seems I over reached yesterday. The stopwatch should have been today, so I did 
pomodoro timer today instead.
